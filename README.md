# Web Scraping using Python

This project demonstrates how to use Python to scrape product data from Amazon, specifically the **title**, **price**, and **brand** of products. The project utilizes libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests for web scraping, along with pandas for data manipulation.

## Introduction

This project automates the extraction of product data from Amazon. We aim to collect product titles, prices, and brands for analysis. This data can be used to explore pricing trends, brand dominance, and product variety on Amazon. Additionally, the project includes scheduling periodic scraping to monitor price fluctuations over time.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **BeautifulSoup** for parsing HTML content
- **Requests** for making HTTP requests
- **pandas** for data manipulation
- **Jupyter Notebook** for documenting and running the code interactively

## Results

The project provides insights into:
- Price distribution of products based on brand.
- Popular brands and product categories.
- Average price per brand or product type.
- Price fluctuation analysis based on periodic scraping.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for scraping additional product details like shipping fees, availability, and seller information.
- Incorporate machine learning models to predict price changes based on historical data.
